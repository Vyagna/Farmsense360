# Farmsense360
This project was designed to empower farmers with essential tools and information for modern, sustainable, and profitable agriculture.

**Key Features of the Platform:**

- **Crop Price Forecasting:** Utilizing advanced algorithms with Scikit-learn, the system provides accurate forecasts of crop prices, helping farmers make informed decisions about planting and selling.

- **Community Collaboration:** A dedicated section built with React JS fosters communication among farmers, allowing them to share information, ask questions, and provide answers to peers in a responsive and user-friendly interface.

- **Modern Practices and Government Initiatives:** Integration of modern farming techniques such as aquaponics, hydroponics, and precision farming, along with a comprehensive database of government schemes and subsidies, is made efficient and scalable with MongoDB. This ensures farmers have access to the latest practices and support.

- **Soil and Crop Recommendations:** By leveraging machine learning algorithms through Scikit-learn and managed data flow via Flask, the platform provides insights into suitable crops based on soil types and environmental factors. This feature enhances crop yield and sustainability.

Through FarmSense360, aimed to bridge the information gap and provide a centralized platform that supports farmers in making better, data-driven decisions, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and profitable agricultural practice.
